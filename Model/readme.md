1. Researched on SRO based human detection dataset, found very good datasets like:
    a. **C2A dataset**: Contains various **disaster scenes**(floods, fire, landslides, accidents,etc) with humans in **various position** (bent, kneeling, lying, sitting, upright) suitable for rescue based operations.

    b. Visdronee: Contains drone based images of 11 different classes( including people and pedestrains)
    c. CCTV based images: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/constantinwerner/human-detection-dataset
